To search a substring in a string we can use "size_t" data structure.
Syntax: 
size_t found = s.find(s1);

Here we are searching for substring s1 in string s. 
this will return the index of the first occurance of the substring.
If the substring is not present then it will return "string::npos".
Example: 
size_t found = str.find(str1);
    if (found != string::npos)
        cout << "First occurrence is " << found << endl;
